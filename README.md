# Rabbit Framework Development with PHP for SOAP API

This README provides a basic guide to setting up a desktop application with a web interface using the Rabbit Framework and PHP for SOAP API communication. 

**1. Project Setup**

* **Install Rabbit Framework:**
    - Follow the official Rabbit Framework installation guide to set up the framework in your development environment.
* **Create Project Structure:**
    - Create a new project directory.
    - Organize your project with the following structure (example):
        - `control/`:
            - `config.php`: Handle all your configuration.
            - `control.php`: Handle all framework operations and logics.
            - `navigate.php`: Handle your route to view pages.
            - `module.php`: Handle all your action script procedures.
            - `page.php`: Handle public pages.
            - `rsource.php`: Handle JSON and CSV CRUD operations.
            - `temp.php`: This controller handles all temp folder operations.
            - `route.php`: This controller handles route logic.
        - `modular/`: Store and run your project modules in classes.
        - `data/`: For your JSON data to be stored and temporary use.
        - `temp/`: Manage the framework system failures for on-time temple, e.g., log session, upload files.
        - `frame/`: The template of the application.
        - `view/`: Pages or functions that you will like to display on the form.
        - `index.php`: The main start of the page of the framework.
        - `error.log`: Handle the system error logs.
* **Install Dependencies:**
    - Use Composer to install required dependencies:
        ```bash
        composer require rabbit/framework 
        ```

**2. Create SOAP Service**

* **Define SOAP Service Class:**
    - Create a PHP class (e.g., `SoapService.php`) that extends the Rabbit Framework's base service class.
    - Implement the necessary methods for your SOAP API:
        ```php
        <?php

        namespace Application\Services;

        use Rabbit\Base\Service;

        class SoapService extends Service
        {
            public function someMethod($param1, $param2)
            {
                // Your business logic here
                // ...

                return $result; 
            }

            // Other methods for your SOAP API
        }
        ```

**3. Create Web Interface**

* **Develop Web Interface:**
    - Create an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based interface in the `view/` directory.
    - Use JavaScript (e.g., with libraries like Axios) to make SOAP requests to your server.
    - Handle the responses and update the user interface accordingly.

**4. Server-Side Logic**

* **Create Controller:**
    - Create a controller class (e.g., `SoapController.php`) to handle SOAP requests.
    - Inject the `SoapService` into the controller.
    - Implement methods to handle incoming SOAP requests and call the appropriate methods on the `SoapService`.
        ```php
        <?php

        namespace Application\Controllers;

        use Application\Services\SoapService;
        use Rabbit\Http\Request;

        class SoapController extends Controller
        {
            private $soapService;

            public function __construct(SoapService $soapService)
            {
                $this->soapService = $soapService;
            }

            public function someAction(Request $request)
            {
                // Get parameters from the request
                $param1 = $request->get('param1');
                $param2 = $request->get('param2');

                // Call the SOAP service method
                $result = $this->soapService->someMethod($param1, $param2);

                // Return the result (e.g., as JSON)
                return $this->json($result);
            }
        }
        ```

**5. Configure Routing**

* **Define Routes:**
    - In your application's configuration (e.g., `control/config.php`), define routes to map incoming requests to the appropriate controller actions.

**6. Run the Application**

* **Start the Server:**
    - Run the Rabbit Framework server (e.g., using the built-in server or a web server like Nginx or Apache).

**7. Desktop Application Integration**

* **Develop Desktop Application:**
    - Create your desktop application using a suitable framework (e.g., Electron, Qt, JavaFX).
    - Implement logic in your desktop application to:
        - Make SOAP requests to your web server.
        - Handle responses from the server.
        - Update the desktop application's user interface.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Security:**
    - Implement appropriate security measures to protect your SOAP API (e.g., authentication, authorization).
* **Error Handling:**
    - Handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid requests) gracefully.
* **Performance:**
    - Optimize your SOAP service and web interface for performance and scalability.
* **Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test your application to ensure it functions as expected.

This is a basic outline. You may need to adapt it based on the specific requirements of your project. Refer to the Rabbit Framework documentation for more advanced features and customization options.

**Remember to:**

* Replace placeholders with your actual code and configurations.
* Adjust the project structure and file names to match your preferences.
* Consider using a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to your project.
